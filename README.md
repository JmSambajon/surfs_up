## Project Overview

We are trying to open a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu and we will be exploring temperature data for the months of June and December. The purpose of this project is to use SQLite and SQLAlchemy to run analytics on a weather dataset of Oahu and determine if the Surf n' Shake shop business is sustainable year-round.
